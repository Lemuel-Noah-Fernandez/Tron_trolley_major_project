a) The overall problem being addressed

In a world where automation is slowly taking over the world, the need for automated guidance in the supermarket setting where the number of items grows, is imminent for consumer convenience. In a bid to increase supermarket efficiency and the customer experience, our project, Tron Trolley, eliminates unneccessary time, and delivers convenience for the customer, by providing a trolley that can guide the customer to the aisle of the item location after an item is inputted into the system.

Our TronTrolley displays the trolley's location, the aisle number of the item, and finally the location of that aisle via a pointer. The functionality is split into the following modules
