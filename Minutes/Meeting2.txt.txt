Meeting 2:
Date: 04/05/2022

Present: Lem, Will, Duncan, Daniel
Missing: Henry

To do today: Consolidate project idea, present to Andre, and allocate modules to individual people
- Get readings for accelerometer and magnetometer
- Integration 

Previous Actions::
- Ideated what we are doing


Regular Items
- Consolidating idea and refining our limits and goals.
- Will 


New Items
- Duncan added to github
- Possible idea of having a magnet in the demo as a restart point
- Modules:
	- Converting accelerometer to distance (Lem
	- Gyroscope orientation (servo moving and person rotating) (Henry
	- Mapping (Will, Lem)
	- Serialisation of data (will)
	- Sound (Assign later)
	- LCD (Assign later)
	- Magentometer (maybe)
- No longer doing the functionality of where our trolley scans stock for missing gaps and requests for stock
- Powerpoint presentation and pre-recorded video of full functionality we will do
- Implement low pass filter and take consideration of constant bias.
- Gyro = servo angle + trolley angle

- Goals for next lab 
	- Finish serialisation 
	- Mapping, get it so it can map the tron lab roughly
	- Basic integration and filtering for accelerometer
	- Gyroscope should be able to convert to angular position (Stewarts code).
	- FIgure out how to combine gyro data with servo orientation with person orientation

Any Other Business
- Henry is away rowing in Canberra and will catch up on content and with team during the week
- Strike next week however we will all still try to be present
