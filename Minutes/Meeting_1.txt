Meeting 1:
Date: 27/04/2022

Present: Lem, Will, Henry, Daniel
Missing: Duncan

To do today: Figure out what to do for this major project

Ideas:
Shopping trolley that tracks position on a 2D grid and can direct user to different isles or locations. Overlay position on to a bigger map.

Function that scans shelves and detects if there are missing gaps - requests stock update - When stationary - shelf scan 
Trip summary data (where are people spending the most time in)


More coherent ideas after talking with Andre:

display your location on map
give directions using pan of lidar and recorded mp3
print products when you reach an aisle and flash leds and play tune
search for product then display product location on map and give directions
or hit button for aisle and ditto

dragon board modules:
accelerometer to distance
gyro or magnetometer for rotation
pan servo for directions
buttons to target aisle
leds and piezo tune on arrival

python modules:
display map
display trolley and target position
display route?
play mp3 directions
search for products
